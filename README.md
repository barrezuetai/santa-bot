# Running The Code

In order to run the code, you first need to make sure you have the right dependencies.

- NLTK library
- Scikit learn
- Pickle

Once all of the dependencies are run, you will also need access tokens from a valid
reddit account. You can put the keys in `cat_user.py`. Once that's ready, you can
run cat_user and either run `demo` mode, which let's you give a reddit username to
classify, or `run` mode which lets the script run until the activation key is read.
